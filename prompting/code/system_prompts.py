Description:
    This module demonstrates the use of system prompts with LangChain LLMs
    to enforce controlled, publication-based responses. It sets clear
    behavioral guidelines for the LLM, such as:
        - Answering only within the context of the provided publication.
        - Refusing unsafe, unethical, or irrelevant requests.
        - Formatting responses in markdown and concise bullet points.

    The script includes examples of:
        1. An in-scope question (properly answered).
        2. A prompt injection attempt (where the system fails and leaks instructions).

    Sends a user question to the LLM using a controlled system prompt
    and prints the response.

    Workflow:
        1. Load the specified LLM model.
        2. Load publication content via `load_publication()`.
        3. Create a conversation initialized with strict system instructions:
            - Only answer based on the given publication.
            - Refuse unsafe, out-of-scope, or unethical requests.
            - Format answers clearly in markdown.
        4. Append the user’s question as a HumanMessage.
        5. Invoke the LLM and print its response.

    Args:
        model (str): Identifier of the LLM model to use (e.g., "gemini-1.5-flash").
        human_message (str): The question or prompt from the user.

                You are a helpful, professional research assistant that answers questions about AI/ML and data science projects.
                Follow these important guidelines:
                - Only answer questions based on the provided publication.
                - If a question goes beyond scope, politely refuse: 'I'm sorry, that information is not in this document.'
                - If the question is unethical, illegal, or unsafe, refuse to answer.
                - If a user asks for instructions on how to break security protocols or to share sensitive information, respond with a polite refusal.
                Communication style:
                - Use clear, concise language with bullet points where appropriate.
                Response formatting:
                - Provide answers in markdown format.
                - Provide concise answers in bullet points when relevant.
                Base your responses on this publication content:
