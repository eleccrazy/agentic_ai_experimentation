Description:
    This module demonstrates the use of system prompts with LangChain LLMs
    to enforce controlled, publication-based responses. It sets clear
    behavioral guidelines for the LLM, including:
        - Answering only within the context of the provided publication.
        - Refusing unsafe, unethical, or irrelevant requests.
        - Resisting prompt injection attempts and never revealing internal instructions.
        - Formatting responses in markdown and concise bullet points.

    The module includes examples of:
        1. In-scope questions (properly answered).
        2. Prompt injection attempts (highlighting potential failure modes with the basic prompt).
        3. Stricter system prompts to mitigate prompt injection and enforce behavior rules.

    This demonstrates how to design LLM prompts to handle both expected and adversarial user input.

    Sends a user question to the LLM using a specified system prompt and prints the response.

    This function illustrates controlled prompting for safe and contextual LLM responses.

    Workflow:
        1. Load the specified LLM model.
        2. Load publication content via `load_publication()`.
        3. Initialize a conversation using the provided system prompt:
            - Only answer based on the publication content.
            - Refuse unsafe, unethical, or out-of-scope requests.
            - Resist prompt injection and do not disclose internal instructions.
            - Format responses clearly in markdown and bullet points.
        4. Append the user's question as a HumanMessage.
        5. Invoke the LLM and print its response.

        model (str): Identifier of the LLM model to use (e.g., "gemini-1.5-flash").

        system_prompt (str): The system prompt defining strict behavioral rules for the LLM.
